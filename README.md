# Arduino with Node-Red

This project was made under a few hours as a small project for the IOT class I took in my 5th semester. It consists of the following :
- Arduino with a temperature and air quality sensor.
- Node-Red, with a dashboard running on my home network which lets me monitor all the sensor data.
- Twitter connection which tweets all the data every 5 minutes.
- Here is the said [twitter account.](https://twitter.com/data_at_mnk400)

#### This is how the dashboard looks like
